# observations + take aways

## current workflow:
* My local machine (hardware) is doing the heavy lifting and model computing.
* All data/storage/python/code/ML done locally on laptop.
* Notebooks and code are stored locally and pushed to github.
* Limited to the computers performance.
* Visualizations and dashboards spread between Tableau and Python

## databricks potential:
* Computing is entirely cloud based - there for insane speed potential.
* Data stored in the cloud aswell
* Notebooks stored within databricks alonf with datasets.
* Much bigger data sets can be manipulated and tested.
* Visualizations + dashboards avalable directly on databricks.
* Sits ontop of datalake(swap) as customizable filtering system.
* Downside = $$$
